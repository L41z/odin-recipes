          <li>1/4 cup (85g) boiled cider or 1/4 cup (80g) apple juice concentrate, optional</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract, optional</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons (28g) butter, diced in small pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><Strong>*Substitute 1 1/2</Strong> teaspoons apple pie spice, if desired.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>To make the crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Work in the shortening until the mixture is evenly crumbly. Dice the butter into 1/2" pieces, and cut into
          the mixture
          until you have flakes of butter the size of a dime.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Add the water 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing with a fork as you sprinkle the water into the dough. When the
          dough is
          moist enough to hold together when you squeeze it, transfer it to a piece of wax or parchment paper. It's OK
          if there
          are some dry spots in the pile. Use a spray bottle of water to lightly spritz these places; that way you'll
          add just
          enough water to bring the dough together without creating a wet spot.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Fold the dough over on itself three or four times to bring it together, then divide it into two pieces, one
          about twice
          as large as the other. The larger piece will be the bottom crust; the smaller piece, the top crust. Pat each
          piece of
          dough into a disk about 3/4" thick.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Roll each disk on its edge, like a wheel, to smooth out the edges. This step will ensure your dough will roll
          out
          evenly, without a lot of cracks and splits at the edges later. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes
          before
          rolling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 425°F.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Lightly grease a 9" pie pan that's at least 1 1/2" to 2" deep; if you use the shallower option, the pie will
          be more
          domed.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>To make the filling: Combine the sliced apples and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <p>
          In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt, and spices. Sprinkle the mixture over the
          apples,
          and stir to coat them. Stir in the boiled cider (or apple juice concentrate) and the vanilla.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 10</h3>
        <p>To assemble the pie: Roll the larger piece of pastry into a 13" circle. Transfer it to the prepared pan, and
          trim the
          edges so they overlap the rim of the pan by an inch all the way around.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 11</h3>
        <p>Spoon the apple filling into the pan. Dot the top with the diced butter.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 12</h3>
        <p>Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11" circle. Carefully place the pastry over the apples. Bring the
          overhanging bottom
          crust up and over the top crust, pinching to seal the two and making a decorative crimp. Prick the crust all
          over with a
          fork, to allow steam to escape. Or cut decorative vent holes, if desired. Alternatively, you can weave a
          lattice.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 13</h3>
        <p>
          For extra crunch and shine, brush the top crust with milk (or an egg white beaten with 1 tablespoon of water),
          and
          sprinkle with coarse sparkling sugar. Place the pie in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to firm up the crust
          while the
          oven finishes heating.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 14</h3>
        <p>
          Place the pie on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake the pie for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature
          to 375°F
          and bake for 40 minutes more, until you see the filling bubbling inside the pie (and perhaps dripping onto the
          parchment). Check the pie after half an hour of baking time, and cover the edges with foil or a pie shield to
          keep them
          from browning too quickly, if necessary.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 15</h3>
        <p>
          When the pie is done — you should see the filling bubbling vigorously, either around the edges, or via any
          decorative
          vents — remove it from the oven.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 16</h3>
        <p>Cool the pie completely before slicing — really. Cutting any fruit pie that's still warm is a messy business.
          The
          filling continues to thicken as the pie cools, and if you cut it too soon it will run out all over the place.
          It's
          better to bake the pie in advance, cool it completely, then warm each slice as needed after it's been cut.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 17</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover pie, lightly covered, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.</p>
